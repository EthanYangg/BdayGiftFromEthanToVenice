        <h1>happy bday from Ethan to Venice!!!</h1>
        <p>idk how to give u the best greeting and decided to build a website for u lol</p>
        <button id="surpriseBtn">Click hereee *</button>
        <div id="surpriseMessage" class="hidden">
            <p>I like how u...</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">-enjoy reading altho they might be spicyyy😭 Wish u have more books and also hope ur parents don't find them out lmao</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">-are so caring for others, being sensitive can be hard for u but it made u so beautiful. u are always so nice it makes me feel good🥹</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">-don't get annoyed by me. When u said u check messages to see me and think it's weird, it's not, I want u like that 🫶</p>
            <p>I like how we...</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">-talk to each other everyday, it's something we gotta do at this point. I can be alone only if I'm alone with u if that makes sense 🤧</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">-never distance each other despite the distance. 🤧 We share our worries without hiding them and comfort each other</p>
            <p>I like u...</p>
            <p>My fav memories from us recently ↓↓↓</p>
            <p>me:</p>
            <p>"Hey umm I’m not sure what to say but I wanna say something to u so I’m just gonna start texting and see what happens😭 I know we prolly not gonna meet in a short amount of time but if we do I wanna let u know that the way I text u online is more like the actual thoughts being sent to u, while in real life im a really anxious person and kinda silly and def not so good with words as I am rn🤧That’s not for certain tho cuz I only started being vocal and stuff once I met u when I talk to others no matter online or real life it just doesn’t have this much vibe in it I think you are the one who gave me this ability to express so fully, so maybe when I see u in person i won’t be much different, either way I’m just excited to see u🫶 And I’m not sure about u and how ur like in real life but just don’t worry because u r literally the best person ever no need to stress about my impressions of u im busy worrying about how u would think😭"</p>
            <p>"I didn’t do any detailed plans of what we gonna do, but like sometimes when I watch reels like the bottom one of the two I sent u last time I imagine us being there❤️ Is it a bit intimidating for u if I call the stuff we might do together as… our future?😭"</p>
            <p>"And the difference between day and night is in daytime it’s busy so altho I want to get in the mood of just loving u😭, r u flustered now reading this😭, anyways I trynna get in that mood but too much chaos happens everyday, but at night, like right now, I start thinking about u crazy everyday, but when I wake up the noises of school and everything covers it, it’s like this continuous cycle, sometimes idk how to think, I don’t know what emotions to feel, when I wanna think of u, I want it to be just love, but there’s also something called unknown, where I don’t really understand how I should feel about everything and it’s like an abstract thing I can’t explain it🤧"</p>
            <p>"But I’m still scared if I keep texting u right now will I hit ur limit😭 I believe nothing is limit for us, I mean the distance isn’t, nothing is, but still, there’s just this part of me that I can’t get rid of, this part of me is still scared of losing u, what if something happens and messes up everything I don’t even wanna think about somehow I still imagine it in my head I get so scared I think I need help the only one who can help me is u and ur here so I’m okay but this part of me is still there and there are still times when I do not feel okay… I think it’s a normal thing, or is it weird? I don’t know I’m confused🤧"</p>
            <p>"And I wonder if u feel the same as me about any of these thoughts 🥹 Do u have any worries like this? Is there something u wanna say?"</p>
            <p>you:</p>
            <p>"wait really?🥹 Its nice to know that I'm the one who got u to be vocal and stuff🤧 I'm excited to see u too but I'm definitely nervous as well...im worried that if we do meet up i say or do something weird or I might do something wrong and I'm scared that maybe because of those things you'll stop talking to me🥹 u said not to worry because, to u, I'm the best person ever but it's hard not to worry cuz i want to be perfect or at least good enough in ur eyes🤧 so ig u can say, if we do meet, I'm gonna be busy worrying about how u would think too😭"</p>
            <p>"reading this makes me worried that ur not sleeping well☹️ if only I can help u sleep easier...but I don't know how😭"</p>
            <p>"reading ur messages always get me flustered😭🥹 u have no idea how many times I've closed my phone, covered my face, and scream quietly while kicking my feet in the air😭😭😭"</p>
            <p>"trust me you don't have to worry about losing me...there's literally nothing bad  I can say about u cuz ur so sweet and nice🥹 yk I'm really thankful I met someone like you..after all the ppl who added me on hoop ur the first one who made me feel like u actually want to talk to me, the first one to not ask me for a pic (cuz istg that's literally the 2nd message they send), ur the first one who respected my boundaries, ur the first normal guy I met online😭 and...ur the first person who actually made me feel something"</p>
            <p>"all I can say rn is...im really glad I have someone like u in my life🥹🫶🏻"</p>
            <h2>Remember that story?</h2>

            <p>"Cuz I know we ain’t even met in real life but everything we got is already enough for me to want to spend my life with u I don’t know why I’m like this😭Maybe cuz ur just so special, even if u don’t think so u r the best person ever I just want to give u as much as I can"</p>
            <p>"Even if there’s bad things happening when we get together, I just wish we can go through them together and I don’t want this to ever end"</p>
            <p>"I never feel like I’m enough for u im trynna improve myself but no matter how much i try i still feel like ur just so much better idk how i even got u in my life it’s crazyyy🤧 I LOVE YOU❤️"</p>
